# ToDo

- Scaling/Norm for both float32 & float64 is 4.0!?
- Why does diff/integrate help with float32?
- 2D room modes don't match theoretical results
- Absorption over 0.9512 Sabs
- Symmetric filters (LP&HP)
- Multiple sources
- Sources with only one voxel
- Multiprocess voxels disabled
- Simulation plugin
- Higher order cartesian stencil
- Optimal PPW (calculate phase error at fmax)
- Directional sources
